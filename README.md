# Hypothesis-Testing
This project aims to test the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers. A team conducted an experiment by randomly selecting 100 users and dividing them equally into two groups. The existing landing page was served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page to the second group (treatment group). Data regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page was collected. In this project, I explored the data and perform a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering the following questions:

* Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

* Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?

* Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?

* Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?
